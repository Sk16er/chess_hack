Chess Plus - Essential Chess.com Tweaks
Welcome to Chess Plus, a user script that enhances your Chess.com experience by adding essential and quality of life tweaks!

##### Features
Auto Queue: The script can automatically click the "New" button on Chess.com whenever it becomes available, saving you time and effort when starting new chess games.
Lichess Analysis: The script can automatically send your games to Lichess.org for post-game analysis, saving you time and effort when trying to analyze your chess games without a membership on Chess.com.
Chess-Helper: The script can automatically detect the chess board and see all of the possible takes or vulnerabilities of the position with many more features, making the game easier for beginners (ex: seeing long diagonals) saving you time and effort when playing chess for the first time.
